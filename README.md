# top-n

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0.

## Sample text files
I have uploaded 2 sample text files under the folder `topN/node implementation` - numbers.txt & numbers-2.txt

Both the angular and node implementations work fine with these files.
Although my Angular app loads the file in browser memory, so I am pretty sure it won't work with files as large as 200GB

## Build Angular Version
1. Navigate inside the parent folder "topN".

2. Run `npm update`

3. Run `bower update`

4. Run `grunt serve` for preview.

## Run Node version
1. Navigate to `topN/node implementation` folder

2. Run `./topN ./numbers.txt 5`
